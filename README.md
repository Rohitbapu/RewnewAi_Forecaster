# RewnewAi_Forecaster
AI-powered renewable energy platform using machine learning for solar/wind forecasting and grid optimization. Real-time monitoring with carbon tracking and efficiency analytics. Provides actionable insights for sustainable energy distribution and environmental impact reduction. 



PROBLEM STATEMENT:
The growing demand for clean energy has led to an increased dependence on renewable sources like solar and wind. However, these sources are naturally inconsistent — sunlight and wind are not always available, leading to fluctuations in power supply and grid instability. Traditional grids are not designed to handle this variability efficiently, often resulting in energy wastage or power shortages.


SOLUTION:
Our proposed solution focuses on creating a smart and adaptive renewable energy grid that can efficiently manage power generation, storage, and distribution. The idea is to integrate IoT-based sensors across energy sources to collect real-time data on power production and consumption. This data will be processed using AI-driven analytics to predict demand and supply fluctuations.
By combining smart technology, data analytics, and efficient storage, this system aims to reduce power losses, improve grid reliability, and maximize the use of clean energy. In the long run, this solution will support sustainable development and ensure a stable, eco-friendly power network for future communities.


Audience Focused:

1. Power Distribution Companies (DISCOMs)
2. Government and Energy Policy Makers
3. Renewable Energy Plant Operators
4. Smart City Developers
5. Educational and Research Institutions
6. General Consumers and Communities

and Even it can be converted as an Product to install in Home Solar System(eg: Inverter Company like Havels,Luminious,etc).
